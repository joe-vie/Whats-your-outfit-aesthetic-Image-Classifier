  <!-- Hello! Welcome to the IMAGE TEMPLATE YAAY \(^0 ^)/
  You're in the process of building something *amazing*
  
  Tips to get started:
  1) Change the text on line 31 to a new title for your website!
    (P.S. You can also change the tab title on line 7)

  2) Paste a link to your model in the "script.js" file (you can find it in the menu on the left)

  3) Press the Start! button in the Webview panel to see your model in action -(*o* )- . Note: It may take a few seconds to load.

  Press the refresh button in the Webview to close the camera.

  4) Add your own colors and styling in the "style.css" file in the left menu!
